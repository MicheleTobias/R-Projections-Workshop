# Overview {-}

## Workshop Description

This workshop is a lesson on coordinate reference systems, an integral part of working with spatial data.


## Learning Objectives

The expected outcome of this workshop is **not** that you will understand everything about projections by the end of the 2 hours.  Learning and understanding projections for geospatial data is (perhaps unfortunately) a life-long endeavor.  Will you have questions later?  Of course!  That is entirely expected.

By the end of this workshop, learners will 

* Be able to define what a projection is 
* Understand why you would choose one over another
* Be able to apply a projected coordinate system correctly to geospatial data in a coding environment  


## Prerequisites

Participants should have 

1. A basic understanding of how to program in the language used in the workshop (either R or Python). 
2. A basic understanding of spatial data formats, raster and vector data in particular.

Participants needing to learn or brush up on their relevant skills can find materials on [DataLab's Workshop Index](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_index/). Suggested preparation includes:

1. [R Basics](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_r_basics/) or [Python Basics](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_python_basics), depending on the focus of the workshop being presented
2. [Introduction to GIS with QGIS](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/Intro-to-Desktop-GIS-with-QGIS/) - just the introductory material about spatial data formats, before the hands-on portion.
